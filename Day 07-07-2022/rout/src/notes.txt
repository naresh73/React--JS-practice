Routing : 

- Router is mainly used for developing single page web application.
- first we have to import { BrowserRouter } (on Router switch) .
- BrowserRouter is switch for Routing.
- in Routing it won't reload the page.
- routing will show us data on DOM without any reload. (DOM manipulation)


Diff b/w State and Props :

State : - State is a built-in React object.
        - Used to contain data or information about the component.
        - we store information about a component.
        - in State we manage the data.
        - using setState we can modify State. (Dom manipulation)
        - States is controlled by components.
        - It can only be accessed or modified inside the component or by the component directly.


Props : - We use Props to pass data from one components to another components.
        - It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function.
