import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

useEffect : useEffect is the only function which we can control function itself (using dependency).
            without using useEffect we can't control any function().

          : dependency Array is available in eseEffect
          : using dependency Array we can control that how many times our function will run 
          : when the dependency Array changes happened
          : we can use multiple dependency Array in  useEffect (if changes made in any one of them the useEffect function will run)
          : [] Empty dependency Array - one time run
